## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how I design Responsive website and use @media query first-time.
For Mobiles devices
@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  ...
}
For Tablets and iPads
  @media only screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px) {
  ...
}

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on in future projects of HTML5 and CSS3 for responsive designs.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for understanding responsive web design and media queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
